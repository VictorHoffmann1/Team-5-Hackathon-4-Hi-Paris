# Team 5, Hi!ckathon 4th edition, Hi! Paris

The present code is developed during a contest called 'HI!CKATHON' organized at the request of HEC Paris and Institut
Polytechnique de Paris, in the context of the Hi! PARIS Center.



My team won Capgeminiâ€™s Best Scientific Approach Award. You can find my certificate [here](https://www.smartcertificate.com/SmartDiploma/Default.aspx?1%7c796969e8-0d62-423f-8b29-d93a3bdb2c6f%7c348cf097-f680-4c34-96f5-68dc51d10e68).

Unfortunately, I can't provide the data used for this Hackathon. However, the code I used for the final submission is available. I highly suggest to read the report in the repository to fully understand our approach.
